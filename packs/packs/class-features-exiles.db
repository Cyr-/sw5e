You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>ADVANCED POWER CORE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level, d10 Hit Die</em><br />Your droid&rsquo;s hit points increase by an amount equal to its level + 1 and its Hit Die becomes a d12.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ALARM PROTOCOL</strong></h4>\n<p>You install an alarm module in your droid, granting the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your droid grants a +5 bonus to initiative to creatures within 5 feet of it.</li>\n<li>You and your droid can&rsquo;t be surprised while your droid is conscious.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ANALYSIS PROTOCOL</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level, Class I Droid</em><br />Your droid can analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your droid&rsquo;s turn, your droid can analyze a target it can see within 60 feet of it. For the next minute, or until it analyzes another target, it gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it analyzes a hostile creature, its attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use its Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</li>\n<li>When it analyzes a friendly creature, the target can end your droid&rsquo;s Analysis Protocol on them (no action required) to add half your droid&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1) to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ARM CANNONS</strong></h4>\n<p>You install dual arm cannons in your droid. The arm cannons have 2 charges. As an action, your droid can use charges to cast the&nbsp;overload&nbsp;tech power, using 1 charge per level. The saving throw is made against your droid&rsquo;s tech save DC (8 + your droid&rsquo;s proficiency bonus + your droid&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier).</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, the arm cannons gain another charge, to a maximum of 4. The arm cannons regain all charges after a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BACK-UP PROTOCOL</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />You install an emergency protocol in your droid, prompting a quick reboot after critical damage is taken. If your droid would be reduced to 0 hit points, it instead is reduced to 1.</p>\n<p>Once your droid uses this feature, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>CELERITY AUGMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>You augment your droid to move a little faster. Your droid&rsquo;s speed increases by 5 feet.</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification twice.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>CHARISMA CHIP</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Class III Droid</em><br />You install a charisma chip in your droid. When an ally your droid can see makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, your droid can use its reaction to give them advantage on the roll.

Once your droid uses this ability, it can&rsquo;t use it again until it finishes a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DARKVISION OPTICS</strong></h4>\n<p>Your droid has darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If your droid already has darkvision, this modification increases its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DURABILITY MODULE</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your droid&rsquo;s durability, granting the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When your droid rolls a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points your droid can regain from the roll equals twice your droid&rsquo;s Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).</li>\n<li>Your droid&rsquo;s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice its level when you install this protocol.

The saving throw is made against your droid&rsquo;s tech save DC (8 + your droid&rsquo;s proficiency bonus + your droid&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier).</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, the flamethrower gains another charge, to a maximum of 3. If the flamethrower has multiple charges, you can use multiple charges to cast&nbsp;flame sweep&nbsp;at a higher level, 1 point per charge. The flamethrower regains all expended charges after a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>FOUR-ARMED COMBATANT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Class IV Droid</em><br />You install two additional arms to improve your droid&rsquo;s combat capabilities, granting it four arms which it can use independently of one another.

This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

This amount can&rsquo;t exceed the number of hit points regained.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE CORROSIVE AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Corrosive Amplifier</em><br />You fine tune your Corrosive Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the next attack roll made against that creature before the end of its next turn has advantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE CRYO AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Cryo Amplifier</em><br />You fine tune your Cryo Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the creature gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE EXPLOSIVE AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Explosive Amplifier</em><br />You fine tune your Explosive Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the creature is also ignited for 1 minute. At the start of each of its turns, the creature</p>\n<p>takes additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and then makes a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC, ending this effect on a success. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the effect ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>POWERED GRAPPLING HOOK</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;9th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em><br />While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SENTRY TURRET</strong></h4>\n<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can&rsquo;t be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TRUESIGHT GOGGLES</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;11th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Darkvision Goggles</em><br />You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>WRIST-MOUNTED GRAPPLING HOOK</strong></h4>\n<p>You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":"","requirements":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Over the course of a long rest, you can modify one suit of armor or a shield. You must have the armor or shield and armormech&rsquo;s implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your modified armor or shield is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.</p>\n<h2>ARMORMECH MODIFICATIONS</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it.

This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you recover and reinsert the harpoon as an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HEAVY SUIT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br />You enhance your suit, making it difficult to move. As a bonus action, you can anchor your feet to the ground.

On a failed save, the creature&rsquo;s weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>OVERLOAD SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Shield Generator</em><br />You modify your shield generator to overload. As an action you can overload your shield. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (their choice) against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they are pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>POWER FIST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor&rsquo;s unarmed strike deals 1d4 kinetic damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action and make an unarmed attack, you can make an additional unarmed attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE POWER FIST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Power Fist</em><br />You further modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor&rsquo;s unarmed strike deals 1d6 kinetic damage and has the following property.</p>\n<p>If you or your target move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making an unarmed attack, the first unarmed attack you make deals additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>REINFORCED UNDERLAY</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level</em><br />You gain a +1 bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>RESISTANCE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You tune your modified armor against certain forms of damage. Choose acid, cold, fire, ion, lightning, or sonic damage. While wearing your modified armor you have resistance to that type of damage.</p>\n<p>You can select this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SEALED SUIT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br />As a bonus action you can hermetically seal your modified armor, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions). Your armor regains 1 minute of air for every minute that you are not submerged and the armor is not sealed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while you are wearing your modified armor you are considered adapted to cold and hot climates as well as high altitude, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SENTIENT ARMOR</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;13th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Artificially Intelligent</em><br />Your artificial intelligence has learned to control the suit without you being in it. It is now a valid target of the&nbsp;tracker droid interface&nbsp;tech power.</p>\n<p>While your armor is acting independently, it uses your ability scores, saving throws, and skills, and it has hit points equal to your engineer level. If reduced to 0 hit points, it falls directly to the ground, and it can not be equipped again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SHIELD AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Shield Generator</em><br />You modify your shield generator to project outward. As a bonus action you can amplify your shield until the start of your next turn. Each creature within 5 feet of you gains a bonus to AC equal to your shield&rsquo;s bonus.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SHIELD ANCHOR</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Physical Shield</em><br />You modify your shield to be used as a portable source of cover. As an action, you can anchor or recover the shield. While anchored, you gain no benefit from a shield, and it does not require the use of a hand. Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a large shield provides three-quarters cover.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TECH BLAST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You modify your modified armor gauntlet with a blaster weapon with which you are proficient. The weapon uses your Intelligence modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and deals 1d8 energy damage on a hit. It has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>WEAPON INTEGRATION ARMORING</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your armor.

When you do so, the damage taken by the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE DEVOTED</strong></h4>\n<p>You gain a limited ability to manipulate the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Force Powers Known</strong>.&nbsp;You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn universal powers in this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Force Points</strong>.&nbsp;Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast universal powers in this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Max Power Level</strong>.&nbsp;Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Forcecasting Ability.</strong>&nbsp;You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF FATE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE FIGHTER</strong></h4>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF FORTITUDE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />You can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be blinded or deafened.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF FREEDOM</strong></h4>\n<p>You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF INTUITION</strong></h4>\n<p>You can no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within 10 feet of you due to not being able to see them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE LIMBER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />When you make your first unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to spend 1 focus point. If you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF METTLE</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use Strength instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE MORTAL</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use Constitution instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE NEMESIS</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;13th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see.

You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill&rsquo;s exploit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aim (Stealth)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to line up a strike against a creature you can see that you are hidden from. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, you gain a +10 bonus to the first attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you are no longer hidden from the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Angle (Perception)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Battle Cry (Intimidation)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you.

If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Charm (Persuasion)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Confuse Beast (Animal Handling)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the beast cannot take actions or reactions until the end of your next turn.

Make a Charisma (Performance) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the next attack roll made against the target before the start of its next turn has advantage.

If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Feint (Deception)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to divert the attention of a target you can see within 30 feet. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can&rsquo;t be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Hacktivate (Technology)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Instruct (Investigation)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack&rsquo;s damage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Intuit (Insight)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can&rsquo;t have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can&rsquo;t have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Tumble (Acrobatics)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature&rsquo;s reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.</li>\n<li><strong>Pocket Sand (Sleight of Hand)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Precision Strike (Medicine)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to strike a pressure point in one humanoid within your reach. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Snare (Survival)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Spin (Piloting)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Study (Lore)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to anticipate your target&rsquo;s action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Wrestle (Athletics)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TECHNOLOGIST&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>Choose one 1st-level tech power.

Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,</p>\n<p>You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.</p>\n<h4><strong>AMPLIFIED SHOTS</strong></h4>\n<p>You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn&rsquo;t involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h4><strong>SAVING THROWS</strong></h4>\n<p>Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ammunition save DC&nbsp;</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>AMMUNITION ENHANCEMENTS</h2>\n<p>The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>CARBONITE SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\n<p>The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>COERCING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>EXPLOSIVE SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.</p>\n<p>The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HALLUCINOGEN SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PIERCING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don&rsquo;t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon&rsquo;s type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p>The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>QUELL SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SEEKING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don&rsquo;t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon&rsquo;s range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target&rsquo;s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don&rsquo;t learn its location.</p>\n<p>The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":"","requirements":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Once you&rsquo;ve invoked a totem in this way, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>TOTEM OPTIONS</h2>\n<p>The totems are listed in alphabetical order. If a totem requires a saving throw, the DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE ACKLAY</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem evokes the ferocity of an acklay, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action. For 10 minutes, your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles, and your Strength score increases by 2. This increase can cause your score to exceed 20.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE HAWK</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem is inspired by the visage of a hawk, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks, and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw by emitting a powerful sound. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is dazed, suffering from the Charmed condition. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the totem, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. A deaf creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE LOTH-WOLF</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem emulates the near etherealness of a loth-wolf, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you (other than the attacker) that you can see, using the same roll. This ability can transfer the attack regardless of the attack&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE RANCOR</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem bestows a resilience reminiscent of a mighty rancor, granting you advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance to poison damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action, gaining resistance to energy and kinetic damage for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE SARLACC</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem channels the experience of an ancient sarlacc, granting you expertise in any tool in which you are proficient.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can invoke the totem to summon the tentacles of the creature: The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the tentacles, the target takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, tearing free on a success.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE VORNSKR</strong></h4>\n<p>With this totem you are able to access the Force-enhanced senses of the vornskr, granting you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you can&rsquo;t be surprised as long as you are not incapacitated.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action to enter a state of hyper awareness for 1 minute or until you&rsquo;re incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":"","requirements":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
